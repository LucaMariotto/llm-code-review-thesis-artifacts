  "title": "Improve PowerShell curl command example to resolve cmd-let alias conflict",
  "body": "### Overview\n\nThe current implementation of the `curl` command in PowerShell inadvertently invokes the built-in cmd-let, causing the `-sO` flags to malfunction. This update replaces `curl` with an explicit call to `curl.exe`, ensuring that the intended executable is used and preserving the expected behavior.\n\n### Details\n\n- **Issue:** In PowerShell, the alias for `curl` maps to a built-in cmd-let (Invoke-WebRequest), leading to unintended behavior when using flags intended for the standard curl utility.\n- **Resolution:** Replace the ambiguous `curl` command with `curl.exe`, which is available by default on recent Windows releases. This update has been verified in PowerShell environments, while CMD users continue to operate with the native `curl` command without changes.\n- **Testing & Verification:** The revised command has been tested in multiple PowerShell scenarios to ensure consistency and reliability. Users on older Windows versions may require alternative instructions, which are noted in the documentation.\n\n### Reference\n\nFor additional details, refer to the official documentation: https://curl.se/windows/microsoft.html\n\n### Update Log\n\n- Revised the command from `curl` to `curl.exe` to bypass the cmd-let alias conflict.\n- Enhanced the documentation and usage instructions to improve clarity and prevent common user errors.\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] Comprehensive update log provided\n- [x] Minimum of two reviews obtained\n- [x] All collaboration points and discussions addressed\n- [x] Changelog information updated for accuracy\n- [x] Appropriate labels applied for upgrade notes\n\n[Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/7142)",
