    "title": "Update curl command usage for PowerShell environments",
    "body": "### Overview\n\nIn PowerShell, the command `curl` is an alias for the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet, which does not correctly process flags such as `-sO`. To avoid this issue, users should invoke `curl.exe` when operating in PowerShell. This adjustment is only required for PowerShell environments; if you are using the Windows Command Prompt, the standard `curl` command functions as expected.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the [curl documentation on Windows](https://curl.se/windows/microsoft.html).\n\n### Changes\n\n- Updated the example command to use `curl.exe` in PowerShell to prevent conflicts with the default alias.\n\n### Proposed Changelog Entries\n\n- Use `curl.exe` instead of `curl` for PowerShell environments to ensure proper flag support.\n\n### Checklists\n\n#### Submitter Checklist\n\n- [x] Changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are clear, concise, and in the imperative mood.\n\n#### Maintainer Checklist\n\n- [x] At least two approvals have been obtained and all review comments have been addressed.\n- [x] Changelog entries are accurate and human-readable.\n- [x] Appropriate labels have been set to facilitate automatic changelog generation.\n- [x] No additional upgrade steps are required for users.\n- [x] If applicable, the change has been marked for backporting with the necessary Jira issue and labels.\n",
