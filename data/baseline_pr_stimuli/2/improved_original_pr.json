    "title": "Dashboards: Enable current value selection via UID for data source template variables",
    "body": "<!--\nThank you for your contribution. Please ensure that you have run all relevant tests and updated the documentation accordingly. For contribution guidelines, refer to: https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md.\n-->\n\n### Summary\n\nThis pull request introduces an enhancement that allows dashboards to specify a provisioned data source as the current selection for a template variable by utilizing the data source’s unique identifier (UID). Previously, the system relied solely on the data source name, which could vary between Grafana Cloud instances.\n\n### Details\n\n- **Functionality:**\n  - The implementation now distinguishes between the two parts of the template variable option: the `text` field continues to represent the data source name, while the `value` field is now assigned the UID. This change enables dashboards to reliably select the intended data source upon initialization.\n  - Backward compatibility is maintained: dashboards that previously used the data source name for both fields will continue to function as before.\n\n- **User Impact:**\n  - Users who utilize data source template variables in markdown panels or as part of query content must update their variable syntax. Specifically, the previous usage of `${variable}` (which returned the data source name) now returns the UID. To display the data source name, users should switch to `${variable:text}`.\n\n- **Testing & Documentation:**\n  - Additional tests have been integrated to cover both the UID-based resolution and the alternative variable format.\n  - Documentation has been updated to clearly describe the change in variable interpolation behavior. Please consult the [Variable Syntax Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/variables/variable-syntax/#text) for further details.\n\n### Release Notice: Breaking Change\n\nThis update modifies how data source template variables are interpolated:\n\n- **Before:**\n  - `${variable}`, `${variable:text}`, and `${variable:raw}` all returned the data source name.\n\n- **After:**\n  - `${variable}` and `${variable:raw}` now return the UID, while `${variable:text}` continues to return the data source name.\n\nAffected scenarios include:\n\n- Displaying the variable in markdown panels.\n- Incorporating the variable in query content.\n\nThe data source picker functionality remains unaffected. Users should update their dashboards accordingly.\n\n### Special Notes for Reviewers\n\n- Verify that the new handling of the template variable options integrates seamlessly without side effects.\n- Ensure that the tests and documentation accurately reflect the updated behavior and breaking change.\n- Confirm that backward compatibility is maintained for dashboards that rely on the legacy behavior.\n",

          "body": "@darrenjaneczek, the proposed changes provide a logical enhancement to the template variable handling. However, this update introduces a breaking change in variable interpolation. For example, given a data source variable `dsVar`:\n\n**Before:**\n```\n${dsVar}<br/>\nName: ${dsVar:text}<br/>\nUID: ${dsVar:raw}\n```\nproduces:\n```\ngrafanacloud-k8smonitoring-prom\nName: grafanacloud-k8smonitoring-prom\nUID: grafanacloud-k8smonitoring-prom\n```\n\n**After:**\n```\nd7bbe725-9e48-4af8-a0cb-6cb255d873a3\nName: grafanacloud-k8smonitoring-prom\nUID: d7bbe725-9e48-4af8-a0cb-6cb255d873a3\n```\n\nIt is essential to include a clear breaking change notice and update the documentation to inform users of the required adjustments.",

It is important to note that the update may introduce breaking behavior in certain edge cases—specifically when a data source variable is used in contexts other than its typical value usage (for example, as a property for `datasource.uid`). I recommend adding a clear breaking change notice to the release notes section of this PR. For guidance, see: https://github.com/grafana/grafana/pull/66466.",
