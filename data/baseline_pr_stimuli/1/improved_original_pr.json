    "title": "Update: Replace OS Alert Dialog with Warning Log for OpenXR Initialization Failure",
    "body": "Fixes #73141\n\nThis pull request implements a change in the handling of OpenXR initialization failures. Instead of displaying an alert dialog that interrupts workflow, the system now logs a warning message. This behavior is configurable via the new project setting **Startup Alert** (defaulting to true), allowing users to choose whether to display the modal alert during startup.\n\n### Rationale\n\n- The alert dialog introduces unnecessary delays by requiring manual dismissal, which can impede rapid development cycles.\n- Logging a warning message provides visibility of the failure in both the console and the Errors tab, in line with other OpenXR error reporting (e.g., **create_instance** failures).\n- The change leverages existing logging mechanisms, ensuring a minimal impact on the overall codebase.\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n\nAlternative solutions, such as disabling OpenXR entirely or enforcing the presence of an active runtime (e.g., SteamVR), were reviewed. These alternatives would require additional configuration changes or restarts, leading to further disruption during development.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\nThe warning message remains in English to facilitate consistent searchability in documentation and community support. Future enhancements may explore differentiating behavior based on the execution context (e.g., runtime versus debug mode).\n\n### Visual Evidence\n\nThe screenshots below illustrate the warning message as displayed in the console window and the Errors tab:\n\n![log_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293226-52fc619c-b0c1-4436-99a9-3d86a8455571.png)\n![openxr_errors_tab_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293237-d8533245-1b0b-4343-9946-c538d8b82938.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218386058-c4ad31ad-5b7d-410b-a65e-d6f352d92ed2.png)\n",
