  "title": "Replace Intrusive OpenXR Alert Dialog with Non-Intrusive Log Warning",
  "body": "Fixes #73141\n\nThis update addresses issue #73141 by removing the blocking alert dialog that appears when OpenXR initialization fails and replacing it with a non-intrusive log warning. Failure conditions include scenarios where StreamVR is not active or when the HMD is turned off or in standby mode. A new configurable project setting, 'Display Startup Alert' (default: true), has been introduced to allow users to control alert behavior at startup.\n\nKey Enhancements:\n- Eliminates startup delays caused by modal dialogs.\n- Provides a consistent logging mechanism for OpenXR failures that aligns with existing error log practices.\n- Offers user flexibility through a configurable setting, accommodating diverse workflows.\n\nAlternative Approaches Considered:\nWhile disabling OpenXR entirely would prevent the alert, this approach requires a restart and is less optimal for users relying on XR functionality.\n\nVisual Evidence:\nAttached screenshots demonstrate the updated warning in both the console and the error log panel.",
