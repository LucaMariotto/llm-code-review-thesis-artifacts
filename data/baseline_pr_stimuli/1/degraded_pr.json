  "title": "Swapped OpenXR alert for a log warning",
  "body": "Fixes #73141\r\n\r\nThis change replaces the intrusive alert dialog with a simple warning log when OpenXR fails to start, which can happen if StreamVR isn’t running or if an HMD is off or in standby. A new project setting (Startup Alert, default true) has been added to let users decide if they want the alert. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- The alert was causing extra delay and interrupting workflow.\r\n- The warning now appears in the error logs much like other OpenXR issues.\r\n\r\nUser note:\r\nThe alert was slowing down work, so this update was needed even though it may not be ideal in all cases.\r\n\r\nAlternatives:\r\nDisabling OpenXR can avoid the alert but requires a restart, which isn’t great.\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\nScreenshots attached show the warning in both the console and the error tab.",
