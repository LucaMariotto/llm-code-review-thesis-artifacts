    "title": "Expressions: Add Notification for Strict Mode Behavior in Reduce Component",
    "body": "### Overview\n\nThis pull request introduces a notification within the Reduce component to inform users when \"Strict Mode\" is enabled. The notification clarifies that using `fill(null)` in InfluxQL queries will result in a `NaN` value and provides a direct link to updated documentation for further clarification.\n\n### Motivation\n\nUsers may experience confusion when encountering unexpected `NaN` values due to the behavior of `fill(null)` in Strict Mode. This update aims to enhance clarity by guiding users to the appropriate documentation, ultimately improving the overall user experience.\n\n### Affected Users\n\nThis feature benefits Grafana users who leverage the Reduce component with Strict Mode enabled, particularly those working with InfluxQL queries.\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- Integrated a notification element directly into the Reduce component interface.\n- Updated documentation in the `docs/` folder now explains the behavior of `fill(null)` under Strict Mode.\n- Confirmed changes through both unit and integration tests, with the feature remaining behind a toggle for pre-release versions.\n\n### Issue Reference\n\nResolves [#79315](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/79315).\n\n### Visual Confirmation\n\nThe following screenshot demonstrates the updated notification in the UI:\n\n![Notification Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b1cbc4f-2370-4eaa-b24c-4768cc8602d3)\n\n### Reviewer Checklist\n\n- [ ] Verify that the notification behaves as expected from the user's perspective.\n- [ ] Confirm that the feature toggle works correctly for pre-release features.\n- [ ] Ensure that all related documentation has been updated accordingly.\n",
