  "title": "Expressions: Enhance Notification Messaging for Strict Mode in Reduce Component",
  "body": "### Overview\nThis pull request refines the notification system in the Reduce component when operating under Strict Mode. The update addresses potential user confusion regarding the behavior of `fill(null)` in InfluxQL queries by displaying a clear, informative message.\n\n### Detailed Changes\n- **Component Update:** Modified `src/components/Reduce.js` to implement a robust notification mechanism with enhanced error handling and detailed inline documentation.\n- **Internationalization:** Integrated a new translation key into `src/translations/en.json` to support proper localization of the notification message.\n- **Testing:** Extended unit tests in `tests/Reduce.test.js` to cover both normal and edge-case behaviors of the new notification logic.\n- **Documentation:** Revised documentation in `docs/notification.md` to include guidelines on the new notification feature and instructions for future updates.\n\n### Testing and Validation\n- Manual testing confirms that the notification displays appropriately under Strict Mode.\n- Automated tests have been updated to ensure comprehensive coverage of the new functionality.\n- The changes have been verified to comply with the repository's coding and documentation standards.\n\n### Impact\nThese enhancements improve user guidance, promote long-term maintainability, and ensure consistency with established architectural patterns. Future work may expand language support and further refine user experience details.",
