  "title": "KAFKA-15776: Implement remote.fetch.max.timeout.ms for Optimized Remote Fetch Handling",
  "body": "This PR implements the new configuration parameter `remote.fetch.max.timeout.ms` as defined in KIP-1018 to enhance the handling of delayed remote fetch operations. The changes integrate with the existing `fetch.max.wait.ms` setting to ensure balanced behavior between local and remote data retrieval.\n\nKey updates include:\n- Integration of the new parameter into the remote fetch logic with improved error handling and logging.\n- Refinement of the fetch mechanism to better manage scenarios with delayed remote data availability.\n- Comprehensive updates to test cases covering both local and remote fetch conditions.\n- Enhancements to the documentation, including configuration guides and operational procedures.\n\nAll tests have been executed successfully. Please review the implementation details and documentation for clarity and consistency.",

        "body": "It is important to note that `fetch.max.wait.ms` is designed to trigger when there is insufficient data to meet the batch requirements. In scenarios involving both local and remote reads, the additional delay is intentional, and only one remote partition is processed per request. Enhancing the documentation with these details would improve clarity.",
