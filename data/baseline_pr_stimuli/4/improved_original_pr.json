    "title": "[Refactor][tsserver] Enhanced Validations and Code Quality Improvements",
    "body": "## Overview\n\nThis pull request introduces several refactoring changes in the tsserver module to improve internal validations, reduce code duplication, and streamline error handling. The modifications are intended to enhance code clarity and maintainability without altering the external behavior of the module.\n\n### Updates in `src/nodeServer.ts`\n- **Conditional Logic Refactor:** The existing switch-case structure has been replaced with an object mapping pattern. This change simplifies the control flow, reduces repetitive code, and provides a scalable framework for adding future validations.\n\n  **Before:**\n  ![Before](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/assets/20498649/af13fa8d-c538-4bf6-b8db-13aa6da0729c)\n\n  **After:**\n  ![After](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/assets/20498649/f9374809-9b43-4322-b3f7-955f9e8ee59d)\n\n### Updates in `src/server.ts`\n- **Validation Consolidation:** Repeated validation logic has been refactored and centralized. This consolidation minimizes duplication and facilitates easier maintenance and potential error handling improvements.\n\n  **Before:**\n  ![Before](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/assets/20498649/a4f733de-3de9-4b00-afae-2897f73e8ef2)\n  ![Before](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/assets/20498649/cbe7b2d6-7d7c-4483-a50b-2adfced63aea)\n\n  **After:**\n  ![After](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/assets/20498649/25886b5b-1f27-42fc-b10e-d0074f075472)\n  ![After](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/assets/20498649/a1711207-c76d-4d2e-baad-fd153bf65260)\n\n### Linting Adjustment in `src/nodeServer.ts`\n- **Standard Compliance:** The usage of `null!` has been replaced with `undefined` to resolve a linting error observed during test execution. This modification ensures alignment with project standards and helps prevent potential runtime warnings.\n\n### Issue Reference\nThis pull request addresses the issue documented in [Issue #57376](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/57376).\n\nPlease review the changes and provide feedback on the refactoring approach and overall code improvements.",
