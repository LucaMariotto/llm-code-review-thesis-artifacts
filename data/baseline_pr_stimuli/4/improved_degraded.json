  "title": "[Refactor][tsserver] Improve validation logic and code consistency",
  "body": "## Overview\nThis pull request refines the validation logic within the tsserver module. The changes streamline error handling, reduce redundancy, and improve overall code clarity.\n\n## Details\n\n### 1. nodeServer.ts\n- Replaced the switch statement with an object lookup to simplify function selection. Benchmarking indicates that performance remains optimal with this approach.\n- Enhanced inline documentation to clarify the purpose and behavior of the lookup mechanism.\n\n### 2. server.ts\n- Consolidated duplicate validation logic to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability. The revised implementation now aligns with established project conventions for error handling and input verification.\n\n### 3. nodeServer.ts (Additional Update)\n- Replaced the use of 'null!' with 'undefined' to conform to best practices and resolve linting issues. This change has been validated through existing test cases.\n\n## Additional Notes\n- This refactoring is connected to the discussion in [Issue #57376](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/57376) and addresses concerns raised there.\n- All modifications have been verified via unit and integration tests. Detailed results can be found in the CI logs.\n",
