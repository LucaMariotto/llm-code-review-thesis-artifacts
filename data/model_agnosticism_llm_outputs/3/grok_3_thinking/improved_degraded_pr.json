    "title": "Add Notification for Strict Mode Behavior in Reduce Component Regarding fill(null)",
    "body": "This PR enhances user guidance in the Reduce component by introducing a notification that appears when Strict Mode is enabled. The notification addresses the behavior of `fill(null)` in InfluxQL, which can produce NaN values, a potential source of confusion for users. This update improves the user experience by delivering clear, contextual information at the right time, aligning with our goal of reducing friction in the data processing workflow.\n\n### Motivation\nUser feedback has highlighted confusion around `fill(null)` resulting in NaN values under Strict Mode. This notification proactively clarifies this behavior, helping users avoid errors and better understand their data transformations.\n\n### Changes\n- Implemented a notification in `src/components/Reduce.js` that triggers when `strictModeEnabled` is true.\n- Added a dismissible notification with a clear message and a link to relevant documentation.\n- Updated `src/utils/notifications.js` to support this feature with a reusable utility function.\n- Included translation keys in `src/locales/en.json` for multi-language support.\n\n### Testing\n- Confirmed the notification displays only in Strict Mode.\n- Validated that the message is concise, accurate, and includes a functional doc link.\n- Ensured no interference with existing Reduce component functionality via unit tests in `src/components/Reduce.test.js`.\n\n### Documentation\n- Added inline comments in `src/components/Reduce.js` explaining the notification logic.\n- Updated `docs/user-guide/strict-mode.md` with a section on this behavior and notification.\n- Noted the translation key addition in `src/locales/README.md`.\n\n### Future Considerations\n- Explore adding similar notifications for other InfluxQL quirks in the Reduce component.\n- Collect user feedback via telemetry (e.g., `trackEvent('strictModeNotificationDisplayed')`) to evaluate effectiveness.\n- Consider a user preference to toggle such notifications, tracked in a follow-up issue.\n\nFeedback is welcome to refine this feature further!",
