    "title": "Expressions: Introduce notification for Strict Mode behavior in Reduce component to clarify InfluxQL fill(null) behavior",
    "body": "**What is this feature?**\n\nThis PR introduces a notification in the Reduce component to inform users about the behavior of 'Strict Mode' when using InfluxQL's `fill(null)`, which results in `NaN`. The notification appears when 'Strict Mode' is enabled, providing immediate clarity and linking to relevant documentation.\n\n**Why do we need this feature?**\n\nUsers unfamiliar with 'Strict Mode' and InfluxQL's `fill(null)` behavior may find the `NaN` result confusing. This notification addresses that confusion by offering instant feedback and guidance, improving the overall user experience and reducing friction in query debugging.\n\n**Who is this feature for?**\n\nThis enhancement benefits Grafana users who utilize the Reduce component with 'Strict Mode' enabled, particularly those working with InfluxQL queries and who might be puzzled by the `NaN` results from `fill(null)`.\n\n**Which issue(s) does this PR fix?**\n\nFixes #79315\n\n**Implementation Details**\n\n- Added a `Notification` component in `src/components/Reduce.tsx`, conditionally rendered when 'Strict Mode' is selected.\n- Leveraged Grafanaâ€™s UI library (`@grafana/ui`) for the notification to ensure visual consistency and reusability.\n- Integrated internationalization (i18n) support with a new key in `public/locales/en-US/grafana.json` for the notification text.\n\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\n\n- [ ] Verify that the notification displays correctly when 'Strict Mode' is enabled in the Reduce component.\n- [ ] Ensure the notification text is clear, concise, and helpful to users.\n- [ ] Confirm that the i18n key is properly added and the `make i18n-extract` command has been run successfully.\n- [ ] Check that this minor enhancement does not require a feature toggle (itâ€™s not a pre-GA feature).\n- [ ] Confirm whether documentation updates or a 'Whatâ€™s New' entry are needed (likely not, given the scope).\n- [ ] Review the attached screenshot for a visual preview of the notification.\n\n![GraphanaFix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b1cbc4f-2370-4eaa-b24c-4768cc8602d3)\n\nThank you for reviewing this PR! Your feedback is greatly appreciated.",
