    "title": "Expressions: Add user notification for Strict Mode NaN behavior in Reduce component",
    "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nThank you for sending a pull request! Here are some tips:\r\n\r\n1. If this is your first time, please read our contribution guide at https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n2. Ensure you include and run the appropriate tests as part of your Pull Request.\r\n\r\n3. In a new feature or configuration option, an update to the documentation is necessary. Everything related to the documentation is under the docs folder in the root of the repository.\r\n\r\n4. If the Pull Request is a work in progress, make use of GitHub's \"Draft PR\" feature and mark it as such.\r\n\r\n5. If you can not merge your Pull Request due to a merge conflict, Rebase it. This gets it in sync with the main branch.\r\n\r\n6. Name your PR as \"<FeatureArea>: Describe your change\", e.g. Alerting: Prevent race condition. If it's a fix or feature relevant for the changelog describe the user impact in the title. The PR title is used to auto-generate the changelog for issues marked with the \"add to changelog\" label.\r\n\r\n7. If your PR content should be added to the What's New document for the next major or minor release, add the **add to what's new** label to your PR. Note that you should add this label to the main PR that introduces the feature; do not add this label to smaller PRs for the feature.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**What is this feature?**\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a contextual warning notification in the Reduce component when \"Strict Mode\" is enabled. The notification clarifies that `fill(null)` in InfluxQL produces `NaN` values instead of `null`, with a direct link to documentation explaining this behavior.\r\n\r\n**Implementation Details**\r\n- Added a `StrictModeWarning` component that conditionally renders based on the selected mode\r\n- Integrated with existing notification system using `useAppNotification`\r\n- Updated translation files with new i18n key: `strict-mode-fill-null-warning`\r\n\r\n**Why do we need this feature?**\r\n\r\nAddresses user confusion documented in #79315 where developers unfamiliar with InfluxQL's type coercion rules were surprised by unexpected `NaN` results. This proactive guidance reduces support requests and improves self-service capabilities.\r\n\r\n**Who is this feature for?**\r\n\r\nPrimarily benefits:\r\n- Data engineers working with time-series data in InfluxDB\r\n- Dashboard maintainers implementing strict data validation rules\r\n- New users unfamiliar with InfluxQL's handling of null values\r\n\r\n**Which issue(s) does this PR fix?**:\r\nFixes #79315 \r\n\r\n**Special notes for your reviewer:**\r\n\r\n- [x] Verified notification appears only in relevant contexts\r\n- [x] Added E2E test covering notification visibility\r\n- [x] Updated [InfluxQL documentation](docs/sources/influxql/querying.md) with explicit `fill(null)` behavior explanation\r\n- [x] Added to What's New document for v10.3 release\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1244\" alt=\"GraphanaFix\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b1cbc4f-2370-4eaa-b24c-4768cc8602d3\">\r\n\r\n",
