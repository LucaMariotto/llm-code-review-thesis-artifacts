    "title": "Expressions: Enhance Reduce component with Strict Mode behavior notification",
    "body": "\r\n\r\n**Feature Description**\r\n\r\nThis enhancement introduces a user-friendly notification within the Reduce component of Grafana. This notification is displayed when the \"Strict Mode\" option is enabled, specifically to inform users about the behavior of the `fill(null)` function in InfluxQL, which can lead to `NaN` results.\r\n\r\n**Purpose**\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this feature is to improve the user experience for those utilizing the Reduce component with \"Strict Mode\" and InfluxQL. By providing a clear and timely notification about the `fill(null)` behavior, we aim to prevent confusion and reduce potential frustration caused by unexpected `NaN` values. This proactive approach guides users towards understanding the system's behavior and encourages them to consult the relevant documentation for more details.\r\n\r\n**Target Audience**\r\n\r\nThis improvement is specifically designed for Grafana users who leverage the Reduce component in conjunction with InfluxQL queries and have enabled the \"Strict Mode\" setting.\r\n\r\n**Related Issue(s)**:\r\n\r\nFixes #79315\r\n\r\n**Reviewer Notes**\r\n\r\nDuring your review, please verify the following:\r\n- [x] The notification is displayed correctly and provides clear information to the user. (See attached screenshot)\r\n-For this pre-GA feature, ensure it is appropriately controlled by a feature toggle.\r\n- [x] Documentation has been updated to reflect this new notification. The relevant section can be found here: [Link to updated documentation]\r\n- [x] The internationalization (i18n) requirements have been addressed, and the necessary translation keys have been added.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1244\" alt=\"GraphanaFix\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b1cbc4f-2370-4eaa-b24c-4768cc8602d3\">\r\n\r\n",
