    "title": "Expressions: Enhance user awareness of Strict Mode behavior in Reduce component",
    "body": "\n\nThis pull request introduces an informative notification within the Reduce component that appears when Strict Mode is enabled. This enhancement aims to proactively guide users regarding the specific behavior of the `fill(null)` function in InfluxQL, which can unexpectedly result in `NaN` values under these conditions. By displaying this message, we intend to improve user understanding and prevent potential confusion or errors during query construction and analysis.\n\n**Key improvements and considerations:**\n\n* **User Experience:** The notification is designed to be non-intrusive yet easily noticeable, providing timely guidance without disrupting the workflow.\n* **Clarity:** The message clearly explains the potential issue and its context within Strict Mode and InfluxQL.\n* **Maintainability:** The notification logic is encapsulated within the Reduce component, ensuring modularity and ease of future updates.\n* **Documentation:** This change necessitates an update to the documentation covering the Reduce component and its interaction with Strict Mode in InfluxQL. Please ensure the relevant sections in `docs/sources/features/panels/reduce.md` are updated to reflect this new notification.\n* **Testing:** Comprehensive testing has been performed to ensure the notification appears correctly under the intended conditions and does not introduce any regressions.\n\nThis update represents an initial step towards improving the user experience when working with Strict Mode and InfluxQL. Future iterations could explore more detailed explanations or links to relevant documentation directly within the notification.\n\n**Merge Instructions:**\n\nUpon approval, this PR can be merged following standard procedures. Please ensure all tests pass and the documentation updates are included in the final merge.\n",
