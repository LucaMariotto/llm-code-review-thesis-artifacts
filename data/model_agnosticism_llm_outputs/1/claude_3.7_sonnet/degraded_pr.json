    "title": "Replaced OpenXR dialog with log message",
    "body": "Fixes #73141\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the alert dialog for OpenXR initialization failure to a warning log message. Added setting (Startup Alert) that defaults to true to toggle this.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\n- Alert dialog is annoying\r\n    - Causes delay when starting project\r\n    - Requires clicking every time\r\n- Warning shows in Errors tab and Console\r\n- Small code change\r\n\r\n### My Problem\r\n\r\nI was trying to make a VR project. The dialog slowed me down. I like to test outside VR first then check in the headset later. The dialog made this harder.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nYou can disable OpenXR in settings but you have to restart editor. Or keep SteamVR running and HMD connected.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nHere are screenshots showing the warning.\r\n\r\n![log_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293226-52fc619c-b0c1-4436-99a9-3d86a8455571.png)\r\n![openxr_errors_tab_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293237-d8533245-1b0b-4343-9946-c538d8b82938.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218386058-c4ad31ad-5b7d-410b-a65e-d6f352d92ed2.png)\r\n\r\n",

On XR-only devices the screen stays black and users won't know what's happening. An alert is better for those cases.\r\n\r\nMaybe make it a setting or have different behavior in runtime vs debug.\r\n\r\nBut yes suppressing the message should be an option for devs.",
