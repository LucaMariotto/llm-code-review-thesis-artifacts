    "title": "Replace OpenXR initialization failure dialog with configurable log message",
    "body": "Fixes #73141\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nThis PR replaces the blocking alert dialog for OpenXR initialization failures with a non-blocking warning log message and introduces a new configurable setting (\"XR/OpenXR/Startup Alert\") to control this behavior.\r\n\r\n## Problem Statement\r\nThe current implementation presents several challenges for developers:\r\n1. The modal dialog blocks the editor workflow, requiring manual dismissal each time\r\n2. It introduces a significant startup delay, particularly on some Windows systems\r\n3. It creates unnecessary friction during development when working with XR projects\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Replace the modal dialog with a warning log message that appears in both the Errors tab and Console\r\n- Add a project setting to control this behavior (enabled by default for backward compatibility)\r\n- Preserve the warning information for debugging purposes\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n- The new setting (\"XR/OpenXR/Startup Alert\") defaults to true for backward compatibility\r\n- Warning messages will still appear in logs regardless of this setting\r\n- This change maintains compatibility with existing projects\r\n- Special consideration was given to XR-only devices where visual feedback is important\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTested in multiple scenarios:\r\n- Normal project startup without VR hardware connected\r\n- With SteamVR running but no HMD connected\r\n- With various OpenXR runtime configurations\r\n\r\nObserved significant performance improvement in project startup time, especially on Windows 11 systems.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nWarning appears in the console:\r\n![log_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293226-52fc619c-b0c1-4436-99a9-3d86a8455571.png)\r\n\r\nVisible in the Errors tab:\r\n![openxr_errors_tab_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293237-d8533245-1b0b-4343-9946-c538d8b82938.png)\r\n\r\nNew setting in the Project Settings dialog:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218386058-c4ad31ad-5b7d-410b-a65e-d6f352d92ed2.png)\r\n",

Since the engine can function perfectly well without XR initialization, a non-blocking notification is more appropriate than a modal dialog.\r\n\r\nThere's an important edge case to consider: on XR-only devices (like standalone VR headsets), the screen may remain black without any visual feedback if XR initialization fails. In those environments, a more prominent alert might be necessary.\r\n\r\nI suggest implementing this as a configurable setting with different behavior for development vs. production builds. Making the alert suppressible is definitely valuable for developers working in mixed VR/non-VR contexts.",
