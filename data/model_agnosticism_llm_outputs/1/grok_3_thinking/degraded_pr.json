    "title": "Changed OpenXR initialization behavior",
    "body": "This PR modifies how OpenXR initialization errors are handled. It used to show an alert dialog when it fails (like if SteamVR isn’t running or the HMD is off), but now it logs a warning message instead. There’s an option called **Startup Alert** to switch this behavior.\n\nThe dialog was annoying since it slowed things down and you had to click it every time. The warning shows up in the console now, which is less of a hassle.\n\nI didn’t like the old way because it messed up my work. I usually code without VR and test in VR later.\n\nYou could turn off OpenXR or keep SteamVR running as workarounds, but those aren’t great.\n\nThere are screenshots of the warning somewhere.",
