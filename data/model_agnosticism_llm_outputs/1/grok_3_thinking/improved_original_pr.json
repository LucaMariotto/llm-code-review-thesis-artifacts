    "title": "Replace OpenXR alert dialog with warning log and optional project setting",
    "body": "### Problem\nThe current implementation displays an intrusive alert dialog when OpenXR fails to initialize, typically due to SteamVR not running or an HMD being disconnected or in standby. This dialog:\n- Causes significant delays (several seconds) when starting a project.\n- Requires user input to dismiss, disrupting the development workflow, especially during iterative testing.\n\n### Solution\nThis pull request replaces the alert dialog with a **WARN** log message by default. Additionally, a new project setting, **\"XR/OpenXR/Startup Alert\"**, is introduced, which defaults to `true`. When enabled, the alert dialog is shown; when disabled, only the log message is displayed. This allows users to choose the behavior based on their needs, particularly for XR-only devices.\n\n### Justification\n- The alert dialog is disruptive to the development workflow, especially for users who frequently test outside of VR.\n- The warning log message appears in the **Errors** tab and console, consistent with other OpenXR failure modes (e.g., **create_instance** failure).\n- The change has minimal impact on the codebase, using existing logging mechanisms.\n\n### Impact\n- **Development Workflow**: Significantly reduces delays and interruptions during project startup.\n- **User Experience**: Provides a less intrusive notification for OpenXR initialization failures.\n- **Codebase**: Minimal changes, ensuring stability and maintainability.\n\n### Workarounds\nPreviously, users could:\n- Disable OpenXR in project settings, requiring an editor restart.\n- Ensure SteamVR is running and the HMD is connected, which is impractical during development.\nThese workarounds were cumbersome and disruptive.\n\n### Testing\n- Verified that the warning log message appears in the console and **Errors** tab when OpenXR fails to initialize.\n- Confirmed that the alert dialog is displayed only when the **\"Startup Alert\"** setting is enabled.\n- Tested with and without SteamVR running, and with the HMD connected and disconnected.\n\n### Screenshots\nAttached are screenshots showing the warning message in the console and **Errors** tab:\n\n![log_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293226-52fc619c-b0c1-4436-99a9-3d86a8455571.png)\n![openxr_errors_tab_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293237-d8533245-1b0b-4343-9946-c538d8b82938.png)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218386058-c4ad31ad-5b7d-410b-a65e-d6f352d92ed2.png)\n",

This ensures that users on XR-only devices are still notified appropriately, while developers can opt for a less intrusive warning during development.",
