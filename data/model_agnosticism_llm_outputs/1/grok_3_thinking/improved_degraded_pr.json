    "title": "Modify OpenXR Initialization to Log Warnings Instead of Showing Alerts",
    "body": "This PR updates the handling of OpenXR initialization failures. Previously, when OpenXR failed to initialize—due to scenarios like SteamVR not running or the headset being disconnected—an alert dialog would interrupt the workflow, requiring manual dismissal. This was particularly disruptive for developers toggling between VR and non-VR environments.\n\n### Changes\n- **New Behavior:** Initialization failures now log a warning message to the console rather than displaying an alert dialog.\n- **New Setting:** Introduced a **Startup Alert** option, which, when enabled, reverts to the previous behavior of showing an alert dialog. This setting is configurable via the project settings under `xr/openxr/startup_alert`.\n\n### Benefits\n- Streamlines development by reducing interruptions from frequent dialog prompts.\n- Ensures visibility of initialization issues through console logs, preserving diagnostic capability.\n- Provides flexibility for users, such as those on XR-only devices, who may prefer immediate feedback.\n\n### Implementation Details\n- The warning message is logged in English, aligning with the system's existing error messaging conventions. Future updates could explore translation if broader accessibility becomes a priority.\n- Updated documentation in `doc/user_guide.md` reflects the new setting and its usage.\n\n### Screenshots\n- [Console Warning Output](https://example.com/screenshots/console-warning.png)\n- [Startup Alert Setting](https://example.com/screenshots/startup-alert-setting.png)\n\nThis change aims to enhance the development experience while maintaining configurability for diverse use cases.",
