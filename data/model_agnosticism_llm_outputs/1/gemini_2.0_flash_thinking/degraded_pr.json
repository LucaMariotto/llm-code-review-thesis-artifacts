    "body": "Fixed it. OpenXR dialog is gone now and there's a log. There's a setting for the alert. Defaults to on, for XR users.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\n- The dialog was annoying when working\r\n\t- It took time to start the project\r\n\t- Had to click it every time, which was bad\r\n- The log shows in the Errors tab and Console, like other OpenXR stuff\r\n- Not much code changed\r\n\r\n### My Feelings\r\n\r\nThis was a problem for me. I like Godot and wanted to do VR. The dialog was a pain because I test outside VR a lot. I'd run the project, test stuff, then later check in VR.\r\n\r\n### Other Ways\r\n\r\nYou could turn off OpenXR, but then you have to restart. If you want VR, you change it back and restart again. \r\n\r\nOr you could have SteamVR running and the headset on. But sometimes it's in standby or SteamVR is off, or you just open Godot without it.\r\n\r\nThese other ways are not good for the user.\r\n\r\n### Look\r\n\r\nHere are some pictures of the log in the console and Errors tab.\r\n\r\n![log_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293226-52fc619c-b0c1-4436-99a9-3d86a8455571.png)\r\n![openxr_errors_tab_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293237-d8533245-1b0b-4343-9946-c538d8b82938.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218386058-c4ad31ad-5b7d-410b-a65e-d6f352d92ed2.png)\r\n\r\n",

If you only have XR, then the screen is black and you don't know what's happening. An alert saying OpenXR failed is the right thing, I think.\r\n\r\nMaybe it should be a setting that's on by default, or different for when you're running the game vs editing.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, it should be optional to make working easier.",
