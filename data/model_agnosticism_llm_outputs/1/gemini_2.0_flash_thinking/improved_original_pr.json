    "title": "Replaced intrusive OpenXR operating system alert dialog with a warning log message and a project setting",
"body": "Fixes #73141\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses an issue where an operating system alert dialog would appear upon OpenXR initialization failure (commonly due to StreamVR not running or an HMD being disconnected). This has been replaced with a **WARN** log message, providing a less disruptive experience, especially during development.\r\n\r\nTo accommodate users who rely on the alert for immediate feedback on XR device status (e.g., on XR-only setups), a new project setting called **Startup Alert** has been introduced. This setting, located within the XR category of the project settings, defaults to true, preserving the original alert behavior unless explicitly disabled by the user.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nAttached are screenshots showing the warning message in the console window and the **Errors** tab.\r\n\r\n![log_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293226-52fc619c-b0c1-4436-99a9-3d86a8455571.png)\r\n![openxr_errors_tab_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293237-d8533245-1b0b-4343-9946-c538d8b82938.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218386058-c4ad31ad-5b7d-410b-a65e-d6f352d92ed2.png)\r\n\r\n",

An XR initialization failure, while important, doesn't necessarily prevent the engine from continuing to run, especially for users not actively working on XR features.\r\n\r\nWhile generally true, it's important to consider the scenario of dedicated XR devices. In such cases, if OpenXR fails, the user might be left with a black screen and no clear indication of the problem. Therefore, having some form of immediate feedback is crucial.\r\n\r\nThe current solution of a project setting with the alert defaulting to true seems like a good compromise, allowing developers to streamline their workflow while still informing XR-only users about potential issues. Perhaps we could also consider differentiating the default behavior based on whether the project has any XR-related settings enabled.",

I've implemented your suggestion by adding a project setting called **Startup Alert** (defaulting to true) to control the display of the alert modal on startup. The warning message in the editor will still be printed regardless of this setting, ensuring that the failure is logged for debugging purposes. Do you think this warning should be escalated to an error? Given that it indicates a \"failure,\" it might be appropriate.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd appreciate your thoughts on the naming and description (help text) for this new property to ensure it's clear and understandable for users.",
