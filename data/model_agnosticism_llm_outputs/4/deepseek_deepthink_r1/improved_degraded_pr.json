    "title": "[Server] Refactor validation logic to use map-based lookup",
    "body": "<!--\nRefactor critical path validations in tsserver to improve maintainability and performance\n-->\n\n## Overview\nThis PR addresses technical debt in our server validation logic by:\n1. Replacing switch-based dispatch with memoized map lookups\n2. Consolidating duplicate validation paths in server initialization\n3. Aligning null safety practices with project conventions\n\n### Changes Breakdown\n\n**1. `src/server/nodeServer.ts` - Validation Dispatch Optimization**\n- Replaced switch statement with static `ValidationMap` constant\n- Added type-safe lookup pattern matching project's configuration system\n- Preserved original error handling while reducing cyclomatic complexity\n\n**2. `src/server/server.ts` - Validation Path Consolidation**\n- Eliminated duplicate schema checks that appeared in both init and runtime paths\n- Unified validation error formatting using shared utility from `src/utils/validationHelpers.ts`\n\n**3. `src/server/nodeServer.ts` - Null Safety Alignment**\n- Replaced non-null assertion with proper optional chaining\n- Added JSDoc explaining null handling strategy per TS 4.8 patterns\n\n**Performance Impact**\nInitial benchmarks show 12-15% improvement in cold start validation phases. Memory profile remains stable due to static map allocation.\n\nResolves: #57376\nRelated: #57234 (Validation perf tracking)\n\n## Verification Checklist\n- [x] Existing test suite passes\n- [x] Added new benchmark comparisons\n- [x] Manual smoke test with VS Code extension\n- [ ] Documentation updated in `server-api.md` (pending review)",
