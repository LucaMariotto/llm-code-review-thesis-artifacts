    "title": "[Refactor][tsserver] Enhance Validation Logic and Code Structure in `nodeServer.ts` and `server.ts`",
    "body": "\r\n\r\nThis pull request addresses issue #57376 by implementing improvements to the validation logic and code structure within the `tsserver` module.\r\n\r\n## `nodeServer.ts` Refactoring\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation in `nodeServer.ts` used a `switch` statement to handle different scenarios. This has been refactored to utilize a more extensible object mapping approach. This pattern can improve code readability and make it easier to add new scenarios in the future without modifying a large `switch` block. However, we should consider the potential performance implications of object creation on each call, as highlighted in the review. If performance becomes a concern, we might need to revisit this decision or explore alternative optimizations.\r\n\r\n```typescript\n// Previous implementation (conceptual - based on image)\n/*\nswitch (action) {\n  case 'a':\n    // ...\n    break;\n  case 'b':\n    // ...\n    break;\n  // ...\n}\n*/\n\n// New implementation (conceptual - based on image)\n/*\nconst actionHandlers = {\n  'a': () => { /* ... */ },\n  'b': () => { /* ... */ },\n  // ...\n};\nconst handler = actionHandlers[action];\nif (handler) {\n  handler();\n}\n*/\n```\r\n\r\n## `server.ts` Validation Enhancement\r\n\r\nIn `server.ts`, redundant validation checks were identified and consolidated. This change aims to improve code clarity and reduce the potential for inconsistencies by ensuring the validation logic is applied consistently in one place. This also makes the codebase easier to maintain as validation rules evolve.\r\n\r\n```typescript\n// Previous implementation (conceptual - based on image)\n/*\nif (condition1) {\n  // Validation logic\n}\nif (condition1 && condition2) {\n  // Same validation logic repeated\n}\n*/\n\n// New implementation (conceptual - based on image)\n/*\nfunction isValid(data) {\n  // Consolidated validation logic\n  return condition1 && (!condition2 || someOtherCheck(data));\n}\n\nif (isValid(data1)) {\n  // ...\n}\nif (isValid(data2)) {\n  // ...\n}\n*/\n```\r\n\r\n## `nodeServer.ts` Linting Issue Resolution\r\n\r\nAn ESLint error was encountered during testing related to the use of `null!`. This has been addressed by replacing `null!` with `undefined`. This aligns with TypeScript best practices for representing the absence of a value and resolves the linting issue, ensuring code consistency and adherence to project standards.\r\n\r\n```typescript\n// Previous\n// someVariable = null!;\n\n// Updated\n// someVariable = undefined;\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** While images were used to illustrate the changes, in the future, providing code snippets or diffs directly in the PR body would greatly facilitate the review process.\r\n",
