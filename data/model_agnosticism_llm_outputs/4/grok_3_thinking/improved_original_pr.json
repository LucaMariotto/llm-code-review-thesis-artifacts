    "title": "Refactor TypeScript Server Code for Improved Maintainability and Performance",
    "body": "This pull request addresses issue #57376 by refactoring parts of the TypeScript server code to enhance maintainability and performance.\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n1. **`nodeServer.ts`:**\n   - Optimized `functionName` by replacing the original switch statement with a `Map` data structure. This avoids object allocations on every call, improving performance by reducing memory overhead.\n   - Changed a type assertion from `null!` to `undefined` to resolve a lint error while preserving type safety.\n\n2. **`server.ts`:**\n   - Consolidated repeated validation logic into a reusable function, reducing code duplication and improving readability.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n- The switch statement replacement with a `Map` in `nodeServer.ts` provides constant-time lookups and eliminates the performance cost of object creation, making it a scalable solution as the codebase grows.\n- The type assertion adjustment ensures compliance with TypeScript's type system, preventing potential runtime issues.\n- The refactoring in `server.ts` adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, simplifying future maintenance and reducing the risk of inconsistent validation logic.\n\n### Testing:\n\n- All existing unit tests in the `tsserver` suite pass.\n- Added new unit tests in `tests/cases/tsserver/` to verify the `Map`-based implementation in `nodeServer.ts` and the refactored validation logic in `server.ts`.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- These changes do not affect user-facing functionality, as they are confined to server-side logic.\n- The refactoring preserves the existing architectural patterns of the TypeScript server, ensuring consistency with the broader codebase.\n- For contributors: To troubleshoot CI failures (e.g., `CI / format`), run `hereby lint` locally and review the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Related Issue:\n\n- [Issue #57376](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/57376)",
