    "title": "Clarify curl usage for inbound agent in PowerShell",
    "body": "The documentation currently suggests using `curl` for the inbound agent setup. However, in PowerShell, `curl` is an alias for the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet, which handles parameters differently and can lead to unexpected behavior, specifically with the `-sO` flags. This pull request updates the documentation to explicitly recommend using the `curl.exe` executable when running the command in PowerShell.\n\nThis ensures that users in PowerShell environments can execute the command as intended, aligning with the behavior in other command-line interpreters like CMD.\n\nFor more details on the differences between `curl` and `curl.exe` in Windows, please refer to the official documentation: https://curl.se/windows/microsoft.html\n\n### Proposed Changes\n\n- Updated the command example to use `curl.exe` instead of `curl` when the context is PowerShell.\n- Added a clarifying note about the availability of `curl.exe` on newer Windows versions by default.\n- Mentioned that the standard `curl` command remains suitable for CMD and other environments.\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] Documentation updated to reflect the change.\n- [x] At least one review obtained and all feedback addressed.\n- [x] Discussion points resolved and consensus reached.\n- [x] Changelog updated with a clear description of the fix.\n- [x] Appropriate labels added for relevant upgrade or compatibility considerations.\n\n[Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/7142)\n",
