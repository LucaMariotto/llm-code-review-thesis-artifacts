    "title": "Fix PowerShell curl command by using curl.exe explicitly",
    "body": "The existing `curl` command example fails in PowerShell environments because the `curl` alias defaults to the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet, which does not support standard curl flags like `-sO`. This change explicitly uses `curl.exe` to leverage the native Windows curl binary, ensuring compatibility with the documented flags.\n\n**Key updates**:\n- Modified command examples to use `curl.exe` in PowerShell contexts\n- Added compatibility note for Windows 10+ systems where curl.exe is preinstalled\n- Updated documentation references to clarify the distinction between PowerShell cmdlets and native binaries\n\nReference: [Microsoft's curl documentation](https://curl.se/windows/microsoft.html) (explains Windows curl integration)\n\n### Validation\n- Tested on Windows 10/11 PowerShell 5.1 and 7.2\n- Verified fallback behavior in legacy CMD environments\n\n### Checklist\n- [x] Compatibility note added for Windows versions\n- [x] Multi-environment testing completed\n- [x] Documentation references updated\n- [x] 2+ approvals received\n- [x] Changelog updated\n- [x] Upgrade labels applied\n\n[Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/7142)",
