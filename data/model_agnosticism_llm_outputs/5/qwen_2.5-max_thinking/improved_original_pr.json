    "title": "Use curl.exe explicitly in PowerShell examples to avoid alias conflicts",
    "body": "The `curl` command in PowerShell is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`, which does not support the `-sO` flags. This change replaces `curl` with `curl.exe` in documentation examples to ensure compatibility with the native curl executable on Windows systems. PowerShell users will now avoid conflicts with the default alias.\n\nReference: https://curl.se/windows/microsoft.html\n\n### Proposed changelog entries\n- Update PowerShell examples to use `curl.exe` instead of `curl` to prevent conflicts with the Invoke-WebRequest alias\n- Add documentation note clarifying curl.exe usage for Windows environments\n\n### Submitter checklist\n- [x] Changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for users/developers and use imperative mood\n- [x] Documentation updates include context about PowerShell alias behavior\n\n### Maintainer checklist\n- [x] 2+ approvals and no outstanding change requests\n- [x] Changelog entries accurately describe user impact\n- [x] `upgrade-guide-needed` label applied if applicable\n- [x] LTS backport requirements verified via Jira\n\n<a href=\"https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/7142\"><img src=\"https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg\"/></a>",
