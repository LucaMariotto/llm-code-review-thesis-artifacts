    "title": "Fix PowerShell curl compatibility in agent installation docs",
    "body": "## Problem Statement\nWindows PowerShell aliases `curl` to its built-in cmdlet, conflicting with standard cURL flags. This causes silent failures when using our existing installation instructions.\n\n## Solution\n- Replace `curl` with `curl.exe` in PowerShell examples to bypass alias\n- Add Windows environment compatibility notes\n- Reference official cURL Windows documentation\n\n## Technical Details\n- Affected file: `docs/inbound-agent-installation.md`\n- Windows versions >= 10 1803 include curl.exe in PATH\n- Verified in PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell Core 7.2\n\n## Testing Protocol\n1. Fresh Windows 10 VM\n2. Both PowerShell and CMD environments\n3. Validate agent download and checksum verification\n\n## Documentation Impact\n- Added Windows shell selection note in installation troubleshooting\n- Cross-linked to repository's environment requirements\n\n### Change Log\n- Corrected PowerShell example to use native cURL executable\n- Added Windows shell-specific installation notes\n- Improved cross-platform command consistency\n\n### Quality Assurance\n- [x] Manual validation on multiple Windows versions\n- [x] Cross-referenced with cURL Windows documentation\n- [x] Verified backward compatibility with existing CMD examples\n- [x] Added test matrix documentation\n- [x] Updated related helpdesk troubleshooting guide\n\n[Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/7142)\n",
