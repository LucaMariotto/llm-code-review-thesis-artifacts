    "title": "Update curl command in PowerShell documentation for inbound agent to use curl.exe",
    "body": "The current documentation for setting up an inbound agent on Windows using PowerShell recommends the `curl` command. However, in PowerShell, `curl` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`, which does not support the same flags (e.g., `-sO`) as the standalone curl executable. This causes the command to fail unexpectedly.\n\nTo address this, the documentation now specifies `curl.exe` instead of `curl` for PowerShell users, ensuring the correct executable is invoked. A note has also been added to clarify that `curl.exe` is included by default in newer Windows versions (e.g., Windows 10 version 1803 and later). For older versions, users may need to install curl separately.\n\nReference: [Microsoft's note on curl in PowerShell](https://curl.se/windows/microsoft.html)\n\n### Update Log\n\n- Updated the PowerShell example from `curl` to `curl.exe` to ensure compatibility with the required flags.\n- Added a note explaining that `curl` is a PowerShell alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`, while `curl.exe` is the standalone executable.\n- Specified that this change applies only to PowerShell; `curl` works as expected in CMD.\n\n### Basic Checklist\n\n- [x] Update log entry added\n- [x] At least 2 reviews obtained\n- [x] Discussion considered complete or non-blocking\n- [x] Changelog information updated\n- [x] Appropriate labels set for any upgrade notes\n\n[Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/7142)\n",
