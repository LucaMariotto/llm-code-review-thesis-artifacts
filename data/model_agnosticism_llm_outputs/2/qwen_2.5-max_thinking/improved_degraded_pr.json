    "title": "Dashboards: Standardize data source template variables with UID resolution",
    "body": "<!--\n\nThanks for contributing! Before merging:\n1. Verify adherence to contribution guidelines\n2. Execute full test suite\n3. Update documentation for user-facing changes\n4. Use draft status for WIP\n5. Rebase to resolve conflicts\n6. Keep titles concise and descriptive\n\n-->\n\n**Summary of changes**\n- Data source template variables now use UID as the internal value\n- Maintains backward compatibility with name-based references\n- Adds explicit syntax for UID/name interpolation\n\n**Technical justification**\n\nWhen provisioning dashboards across environments, data source names may vary while UIDs remain consistent. This change:\n- Resolves ambiguity in multi-data-source environments\n- Enables deterministic selection of provisioned data sources\n- Maintains backward compatibility through dual-resolution logic\n\n**Implementation details**\n\n1. Modified `src/utils/auth.js` to prioritize UID lookups\n2. Added deprecation warning for legacy name-based references\n3. Introduced explicit interpolation syntax:\n   - `${dsVar}` returns UID (consistent with :raw)\n   - `${dsVar:text}` returns human-readable name\n\n**User impact**\n\nDashboard authors using:\n- Data source variables in text panels\n- Custom query formatting\n- Legacy provisioning workflows\n\nWill need to:\n1. Update interpolation syntax as shown in examples\n2. Verify data source UID consistency across environments\n\n**Documentation updates**\n\nAdded migration guide to:\n- User documentation (docs/sources/dashboards/variables.md)\n- Release notes for v10.1\n\n**Breaking changes**\n\n⚠️ Default variable interpolation now returns UID instead of name\n\nMigration examples:\n\n```diff\n- Current usage: ${dsVar}\n+ UID format: ${dsVar} (now returns UID)\n+ Name format: ${dsVar:text}\n```\n\nAffected areas:\n- Text panel content\n- Custom query formatting\n- Scripts using variable substitution",
