    "body": "Fixed issue #73141 maybe\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the alert when OpenXR doesn't work to just a log. There's a new setting called **Startup Alert** (defaults to on) to control this for people who only use XR.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\n- The pop-up is annoying for me when I'm working\r\n    - It takes forever to go away when starting (like, a few seconds)\r\n    - I have to click it every time, which is bad when I'm trying stuff\r\n- The log shows up in the Errors tab (in the editor) and in the Console, like other OpenXR problems\r\n- It was a small change (one line of code or something)\r\n\r\n### My Feelings\r\n\r\nThis was a problem for me. Godot is great and I wanted to make a VR game. This alert made it hard because I like to test things outside of VR first. I only use the headset when I have something new to try.\r\n\r\n### Other Ways\r\n\r\nYou could turn off OpenXR in the settings, but you have to restart the editor. If you want to test in VR again, you have to change it back and restart. \r\n\r\nAlso, you could make sure SteamVR is running and the headset is plugged in. But sometimes the headset is off, or SteamVR is closed, or I just want to open Godot without doing all that.\r\n\r\nI think these other ways are not good for users\r\n\r\n### Pictures\r\n\r\nHere are some pictures of the log in the console and Errors tab.\r\n\r\n![log_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293226-52fc619c-b0c1-4436-99a9-3d86a8455571.png)\r\n![openxr_errors_tab_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293237-d8533245-1b0b-4343-9946-c538d8b82938.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218386058-c4ad31ad-5b7d-410b-a65e-d6f352d92ed2.png)\r\n\r\n",
