    "title": "Dashboards: Enhance Data Source Template Variable Options with UID for Reliable Selection",
    "body": "This pull request introduces a significant enhancement to how data source template variables function within dashboards. It addresses inconsistencies that can arise in provisioned environments where data source names might vary across instances.\n\n**Purpose of this change:**\n\nThis update modifies the underlying mechanism for setting the current value of data source template variables. Instead of relying on the data source name, which can be ambiguous or inconsistent, the system now utilizes the unique identifier (UID) of the data source. This ensures that the intended data source is consistently selected, regardless of its name.\n\nPreviously, the 'value' field within the option structure was underutilized. This change leverages this field to store the data source UID, providing a more robust and reliable method for identifying and selecting data sources in template variables.\n\n**Benefits of this change:**\n\n* **Improved Reliability in Provisioned Environments:** When dashboards and data sources are provisioned programmatically, the names might not always be identical across different Grafana instances. Using the UID eliminates this potential point of failure, guaranteeing the correct data source is selected.\n* **Enhanced Consistency:** By prioritizing the UID, this change ensures a more consistent experience for users, especially in complex environments with numerous data sources.\n* **More Predictable Behavior:** Selecting data sources based on a unique identifier offers a more predictable and less error-prone approach compared to relying on potentially variable names.\n\n**Impact and Migration:**\n\nThis change introduces a breaking change in how data source template variables are interpolated. Previously, the default interpolation `${dsVar}` would output the data source name. Now, it will output the data source UID. To maintain the previous behavior of displaying the data source name, users will need to explicitly use the `:text` modifier in their variable interpolation, like this:\n\n```\n${dsVar}        // Now outputs the data source UID\nName: ${dsVar:text} // Outputs the data source name (previous default)\nUID: ${dsVar:raw}  // Outputs the data source UID (remains unchanged)\n```\n\n**Affected Areas:**\n\nUsers who utilize data source template variables in the following contexts might need to make adjustments:\n\n* **Text Panels:** If data source variables are displayed directly in text panels, the output will now be the UID instead of the name.\n* **Query Editors:** Queries that directly use the interpolated variable without the `:text` modifier will now be filtering by the data source UID.\n\n**Mitigation Strategy:**\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition, we recommend the following:\n\n* **Review Existing Dashboards:** Identify dashboards that use data source template variables and check how they are being interpolated.\n* **Update Interpolations:** Modify the variable interpolations in text panels and queries to use the `:text` modifier where the data source name is required.\n\n**Documentation Update:**\n\nDetailed documentation regarding this change and its implications has been updated and can be found [Link to updated documentation]. This documentation provides further guidance on how to adapt existing dashboards and leverage the new UID-based selection.\n\n**Testing:**\n\nComprehensive testing has been performed to ensure the reliability of the new UID-based selection and to validate the backward compatibility for older dashboards that rely on data source names. New tests have been added to specifically cover the alternative variable form (`:text`).",

          "body": "@darrenjaneczek This change to use the data source UID for template variable options makes sense for improving consistency, especially in provisioned environments. It's good that older dashboards relying on the name will still function. To ensure a smooth transition for users, we should clearly communicate the breaking change and the necessary adjustments in the release notes and potentially in a dedicated blog post. It would also be beneficial to highlight the benefits of this more robust approach.",
