    "title": "Removed OpenXR alert and used a log message instead",
    "body": "Fixes #73141\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the alert when OpenXR fails and just shows a warning in logs. I added a setting called Startup Alert (default=true) to toggle this. This helps users with XR-only devices.\r\n\r\n### Why I did this\r\n\r\n- Alert dialog is annoying\r\n    - It makes starting slow\r\n    - You have to click it every time\r\n- Warning shows in Errors tab and Console\r\n- It's a small change\r\n\r\n### My experience\r\n\r\nI got annoyed by this. I was making a VR project in Godot which is cool software. The popup slowed me down because I like to test stuff without VR first for speed, then test in VR later when things are ready.\r\n\r\n### Other ways to fix\r\n\r\nYou can disable OpenXR in settings but then you have to restart the editor. Or you can make sure SteamVR is running but that's annoying too.\r\n\r\nThese aren't good solutions\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nHere are some pictures of the warning.\r\n\r\n![log_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293226-52fc619c-b0c1-4436-99a9-3d86a8455571.png)\r\n![openxr_errors_tab_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218293237-d8533245-1b0b-4343-9946-c538d8b82938.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2136005/218386058-c4ad31ad-5b7d-410b-a65e-d6f352d92ed2.png)\r\n\r\n",

The alert is needed in that case.\r\n\r\nThis should be a setting with alert as default, or maybe different in debug vs release.\r\n\r\nBut I agree the option to turn it off is good for development.",
