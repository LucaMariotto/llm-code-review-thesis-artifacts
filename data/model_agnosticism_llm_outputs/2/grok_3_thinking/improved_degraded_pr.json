    "title": "Use UID for Data Source Template Variables in Dashboards",
    "body": "**What does this change do?**\n\nThis update modifies dashboard behavior to select data sources using their unique identifier (UID) rather than their name. This ensures consistency, especially in provisioned environments where data source names may vary across instances. Existing dashboards should remain functional, though some adjustments may be required for variable interpolations.\n\n**Why is this change needed?**\n\nIn provisioned environments, data source names can differ between instances, leading to inconsistent behavior when selecting data sources alphabetically. By using the UID, we ensure that the intended data source is selected reliably, improving dashboard portability and reducing configuration errors.\n\n**Who might use this change?**\n\nThis change benefits users managing multiple data sources, particularly in cloud or provisioned setups, by ensuring the correct data source is selected by default. It also aids in maintaining consistency across different environments.\n\n**Extra notes:**\n\n- **Documentation Update:** A detailed documentation update is pending and will be provided in a future release to guide users through any necessary adjustments.\n- **User Action Required:** Users may need to update their dashboards if they rely on data source names in variable interpolations. See the breaking change notice below for details.\n\n**Breaking Change Notice**\n\nData source template variables now use the UID as their value instead of the name. This affects variable interpolations in dashboards. For example:\n- To display the data source name, use `${dsVar:text}` instead of `${dsVar}`.\n- The default interpolation `${dsVar}` now returns the UID.\n\nUsers should review and update their dashboards, particularly in text panels or queries where the data source name was previously used. The data source picker remains unchanged.",
